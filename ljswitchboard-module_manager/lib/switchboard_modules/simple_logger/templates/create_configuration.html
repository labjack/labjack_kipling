    <br> This will be the page to create a new configuration. 
    <br> It will need to be able to save a config as JSON, have it verified by ljswitchboard-simple_logger functions.
    <br> This will need to be a form with text boxes for user inputs on register selections, and Logger behavior.
    <br> Some configuration settings will be hard coded in the JSON.
